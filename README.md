# 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Development Hub — shoshinmas

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a developer passionate about secure, reliable software and continuously improving my skills in secure coding, web applications, and defensive practices.

This README highlights my approach to **cybersecurity-aware development**, links to security-related work, and outlines how I manage security concerns across projects.

## 🚀 About Me

🧠 Full-stack developer with a focus on **secure, maintainable code**  
🔍 Interested in application security, secure APIs, threat awareness, and DevSecOps  
📚 Constantly learning secure practices and improving risk-aware development

---

## 🔐 Security Philosophy

Security isn’t an afterthought — it’s part of development from day one. I follow **secure coding principles**, including:

- Input validation & sanitization  
- Least privilege access  
- Dependency management & vulnerability scanning  
- Static and dynamic analysis where applicable  
- Responsible disclosure practices  

These principles help me catch issues early and build resilient software.

## 🛠️ Security Highlights

### 🚧 Secure Coding Practices

Every project I maintain or contribute to includes:

- **Documentation of security considerations**
- **Guidelines for secure deployment**
- **Links to vulnerability reporting processes**
- **Security headers & configurations where relevant**

---

## 📂 Security-Relevant Projects

Here are some repositories with a **security focus** or relevant context:

🔗 **<Links to your repos with secure code, e.g.:>**

- **url_shortener** — secure URL shortening service with validation and sanitization  
- **quizApp / quizApp2** — examples of input handling and session protection  

_Feel free to explore, fork, or use as templates while applying secure practices._

## 🧰 Tools & Workflows

I integrate or recommend the following where applicable:

| Category | Tools / Practices |
|----------|------------------|
| Static Analysis | Linters, CodeQL, ESLint |
| Dependency Security | SCA tools, Dependabot |
| Secrets Detection | pre-commit hooks, scanning tools |
| CI/CD Security | Automated tests with security checks |
| Documentation | Clear README + SECURITY.md files |

---

## 📝 Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a potential vulnerability in any of my repositories:

1. **Open an issue** and tag it with `security`  
2. Provide details and proof-of-concept safely  
3. Await confirmation and coordinated fix
